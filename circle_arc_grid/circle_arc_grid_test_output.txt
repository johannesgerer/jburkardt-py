CIRCLE_ARC_GRID_DISPLAY_TEST:
  CIRCLE_ARC_GRID_DISPLAY can display a grid of points along a circular arc.

  Graphics data saved in file "circle_arc_grid_display.png"

CIRCLE_ARC_GRID_DISPLAY_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.

CIRCLE_ARC_GRID_POINTS_TEST
  CIRCLE_ARC_GRID_POINTS returns points along a circular arc.
  In this example, we compute points on a 90 degree arc.

  Radius =           2
  Center =           5  5

  Angle 1 =          0
  Angle 2 =          90
  Number of points = 20

  Some points on the arc:

     0               7               5
     1         6.99317         5.16516
