FD1D_HEAT_IMPLICIT_TEST:
  Python version.
  Test the FD1D_HEAT_IMPLICIT library.

FD1D_HEAT_IMPLICIT_TEST01:
  Compute an approximate solution to the time-dependent
  one dimensional heat equation:
    dH/dt - K * d2H/dx2 = f(x,t)
  Run a simple test case.

  X interval is [0.000000,1.000000]
  X spacing is 0.050000
  Number of T values = 201
  T interval is [0.000000,80.000000]
  T spacing is 0.400000
  Constant K = 0.002
  CFL coefficient = 0.32
