      FEM1D <br> Piecewise Linear Finite Element Method for 1D problem.
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM1D</b> 
      is a Python program which 
      applies the finite element method (FEM) to a 1D linear two point
      boundary value problem (BVP), using piecewise linear basis functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The BVP to be solved is:
      <pre>
        -u'' = x * ( x + 3 ) * exp ( x )  over the interval 0 < x < 1
        u(0) = 0.0
        u(1) = 0.0
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The exact solution is:
      <pre>
        u(x) = x * ( 1 - x ) * exp ( x )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A version of the finite element method is used.  Six equally spaced
      nodes are defined, from 0.0 to 1.0, dividing the interval into 5
      elements.  At node I, we associate a "hat" function, or piecewise
      linear basis function, PSI(I)(X), which has the value 1 at that node, 
      is 0 at all other nodes.  
    </p>

    <p>
      We look for an approximate solution to our problem of the form
      <pre>
        UH(X) = sum ( 1 <= I <= 6 ) C(I) * PSI(I,X)
      </pre>
      so that now the problem becomes the determination of the unknown
      coefficients C.
    </p>

    <p>
      We take the original BVP, multiply by test function PSI(J,X), integrate
      over the region, and apply integration by parts, to obtain a linear system
      of the form
      <pre>
        A * C = F
      </pre>
      We modify the first and last rows of the linear system to enforce the
      boundary conditions, then solve to determine the values of C.
