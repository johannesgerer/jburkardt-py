BALL_GRID_DISPLAY_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.

BALL_GRID_COUNT_TEST:
  BALL_GRID_COUNT counts the number of grid points needed
  for a grid of points inside a ball of radius R and center C.

  N = number of subintervals of the horizontal radius.
  NG = resulting number of grid points.

BALL_GRID_COUNT_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.

BALL_GRID_POINTS_TEST:
  BALL_GRID_POINTS can define a grid of points
  with N+1 points on a horizontal or vertical radius,
  based on any ball.

  We use N = 4
  Radius R = 2
  Center C = (1,5,2)

  Number of grid points will be 389
