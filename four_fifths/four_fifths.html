    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>FOUR_FIFTHS</b>,
      a Python library which
      searches for a solution to the problem of finding
      four fifth powers that sum to a fifth power, that is, integers a,
      b, c, d and e such that a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5=e^5.  Euler conjectured
      that no solution was possible.  The code is by Brian Hayes.
