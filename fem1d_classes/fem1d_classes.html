      FEM1D_CLASSES <br> Classes for the 1D Finite Element Method
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM1D_CLASSES</b> 
      is a Python library which
      defines classes useful for solving a boundary value problem (BVP)
      of the form u''+2u'+u=f in 1 spatial dimension, 
      using the finite element method (FEM),
      by Mike Sussman.
    </p>

    <p>
      FEM1D_CLASSES is written in a way that is intended to suggest how
      FENICS is used to define finite element problems.  
    </p>

    <p>
      FEM1D_CLASSES includes the following classes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          class Mesh ( object ): which stores the number of nodes,
          the interval endpoints, the node coordinates, and the
          sets of nodes that define each element;
        </li>
        <li>
          class Shapefns ( object ): which defines the quadratic
          Lagrange shape functions and their derivatives;
        </li>
        <li>
          class FiniteElement ( object ): which takes a mesh and a set of
          shape functions, and the index of a particular element, and
          evaluates the integral over this element of a shape
          function or its derivative multiplied by zero, one, or two 
          arbitrary functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          class FunctionSpace ( object ): which takes a mesh and a set of
          shape functions and evaluates the integral over the entire region
          of a product in which the first factor is a shape function, its 
          derivative, or an arbitrary function, and the second factor is a 
          shape function or its derivative.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
