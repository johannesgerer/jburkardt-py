    <p>
      <b>FEM1D_BVP_QUADRATIC</b>
      is a Python program which
      applies the finite element method, with piecewise quadratic elements,
      to a two point boundary value problem in one spatial dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      The BVP to be solved is:
      <pre>
        -u'' = x * ( x + 3 ) * exp ( x )  over the interval 0 < x < 1
        u(0) = 0.0
        u(1) = 0.0
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The exact solution is:
      <pre>
        u(x) = x * ( 1 - x ) * exp ( x )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To compute a finite element approximation, a set of n equally spaced
      nodes is defined from 0.0 to 1.0, a set of piecewise quadratic basis functions
      is set up, with one basis function associated with each node,
      and then an integral form of the BVP is used, in which the differential
      equation is multiplied by each basis function, and integration by parts is
      used to simplify the integrand.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple three point Gauss quadrature formula is used to estimate the
      resulting integrals over each interval.
